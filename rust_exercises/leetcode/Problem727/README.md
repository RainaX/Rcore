This directory contains Java and Rust implementation for leetcode problem 727: Minimum Window Subsequence

## Problem Descrition

Given strings `S` and `T`, find the minimum (contiguous) **substring** `W` of `S`, so that `T` is a **subsequence** of `W`.

If there is no such window in `S` that covers all characters in `T`, return the empty string `""`. If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.
